# bread-and-butter

**Little project to learn the bread and butter ( :sweat_smile: ) of Elixir**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `bread_and_butter` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:bread_and_butter, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `bread_and_butter` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:bread_and_butter]]
    end
    ```
